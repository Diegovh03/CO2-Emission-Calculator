CO2 Emission Calculator
Hey there, I did a simple calculator in  Python. This  application provides a simple GUI for calculating CO2 emissions based on energy consumption data. It is designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their energy use across various sources such as Hydro, Natural Gas, Wind, Solar, and Coal. The calculator takes the amount of energy consumed from each source (in kWh) and calculates the equivalent CO2 emissions using predetermined emission factors.
